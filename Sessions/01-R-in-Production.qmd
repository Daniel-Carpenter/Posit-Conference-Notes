# Session: R in Production

## Misc. Facts

-   bacth: anything that is going to run at an interval, such as a database update.

-   Deploy code, vs. render

    -   `pak::pak`: faster than `install.packages()` since runs in parallel, does dependancies, generally easy and fast.

        -   Use `rig` to install R

        -   Use `PPPM` for sourcing public binaries.
        
- In a project, use the `R/` folder for the reused code

- Remember that the server runs on UTC

- Use the `ragg` package on linux to produce the same level of graphics.

# The Whole Game

-   "You cannot do data science if you do not understand Git"

## GitHub Actions

-   Description: Able to run jobs, like R, python scripts, shiny apps, integrates well with cron (cron generated with LLM, verified with cron guru, add comment)

### Benefits

- Auto-Commits back to GitHub after running the code

- Great for batch jobs



### Cons

- Must be run every 60 days or else it will stop running.


### Tips:

-   Find a template or create one on ChatGPT, no one really writes these by hand.

-   Use the same naming before the file extension

-   Pick a random minute in the hour to schedule the job because most do 0 or 5's

-   You will need to install every package that the code will run, within the GitHub action

-   Waiting a bit can help


## Posit Connect

- Key use case: shiny apps

- better dependancy installation system

## Logging

* In production code, a good idea would be to add log messages throughout the code, such as using `cat('Message', file = sterr())`. Also, could do informative chunk naming.

* The `logger` package enhaces this by adding warnings, errors, etc, while integrating variables through `glue`


## Authentication

* Federated authetication trumps enctryted authentication. However, your IT team sets up federated. Posit Connect allows for this.
