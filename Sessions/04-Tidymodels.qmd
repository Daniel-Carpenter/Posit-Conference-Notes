# Time to event

## Explanation
> Predict the probability of an event happening at different times, considering various factors that might influence the timing.

Time-to-event models, also known as survival models, are statistical methods used to analyze the time until a specific event occurs, such as failure, death, or recovery. They help predict the probability of an event happening at different times, considering various factors that might influence the timing.

Key points:
- **Focus on Time:** These models analyze the duration until an event happens.
- **Events:** Commonly used to study events like equipment failure, patient survival, or customer churn.
- **Censoring:** Accounts for incomplete data, like when the event hasn't happened by the study's end.
- **Hazard Function:** Describes the risk of the event occurring at a specific time.

Time-to-event models are widely used in fields like medicine, engineering, and finance for predicting outcomes over time.

# Fair machine learning

<https://simonpcouch.github.io/conf-24/#/>

- A badly tuned model could lead to less equitable outcomes for people

- A badly tuned model could mean under valued or overvalued leading to incorrect results



# Tidypredict and Recipes

- Can run models and create predictions then insert them to a database

## Orbital

- Take the tidymodel and concisely display what happened (communicate)

- Note very new, and not all models work this way. Tree and linear models work.
