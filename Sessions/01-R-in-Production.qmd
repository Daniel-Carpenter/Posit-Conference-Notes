# Session: R in Production

## Misc. Facts

-   bacth: anything that is going to run at an interval, such as a database update.

-   Deploy code, vs. render

    -   `pak::pak`: faster than `install.packages()` since runs in parallel, does dependancies, generally easy and fast.

        -   Use `rig` to install R

        -   Use `PPPM` for sourcing public binaries.

# The Whole Game

-   "You cannot do data science if you do not understand Git"

## GitHub Actions

-   Description: Able to run jobs, like R, python scripts, shiny apps, integrates well with cron (cron generated with LLM, verified with cron guru, add comment)

-   Tips:

    -   Find a template or create one on ChatGPT, no one really writes these by hand.

    -   Use the same naming before the file extension

    -   Pick a random minute in the hour to schedule the job because most do 0 or 5's

    -   You will need to install every package that the code will run, within the GitHub action
