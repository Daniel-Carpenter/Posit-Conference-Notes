### Key Takeaways

- **RAG Application:** Use Databricks to build a Shiny app that
  interacts with internal documents through an LLM, leveraging database
  permissions for user access control.
- **Copilot with R Shiny:** Utilize the `chatr` package to integrate
  LLMs into RStudio, and optimize LLM prompts by keeping them short and
  specific.
- **Data Storytelling with AI:** Focus on context, storytelling, and
  impact when presenting data to ensure it resonates with the audience.

### Talk 1: RAG LLM for Internal Documents

> **Context: Databricks**

- **RAG Application:**
  - Use a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to interact with
    and answer questions about your document library via an LLM.
  - Build a Shiny app connected to Databricks for document interaction.
  - **Access Control:** Utilize Databricks’ database permissions to
    manage user access without duplicating controls.

### Talk 2: Copilot with R Shiny

- **`chatr` Package:**
  - Integrate LLMs directly into RStudio using the `chatr` package.
  - **Unit Testing:** Use LLMs to assist in writing `testthat` unit
    tests in R.
  - **Prompting Tips:**
    - Keep LLM prompts short, specific, and focused on a single task.
    - LLMs can recreate Shiny components from HTML input.

### Talk 3: Data Storytelling with AI

- **Modes of Persuasion:**
  1.  **Logic:** Use data and methods.
  2.  **Trust:** Build credibility.
  3.  **Emotion:** Create a compelling narrative.
  4.  **Timing:** Present information at the right moment.
- **Contextual Responsibility:**
  - Ensure the context of your data is clear and relevant.
  - **Quote:** “A number alone is not important; context helps the
    viewer understand its significance.”
- **Storytelling:**
  - Engage the audience by making them active participants in the story.
  - **Transparency:** You don’t need to disclose that you used an LLM in
    creating the story.
- **Impact:**
  - You are the voice of your data; how you present it affects its
    influence.
